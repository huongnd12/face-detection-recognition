# Face Detection and Recognition

The project uses basic Computer Vision techniques to develop a simple program to detect and recognize human face.

It contains 2 sections:
- Detect human face using Haar Cascade technique and save his/her face image and name
- Recognize human faces with corresponding identification which were save in the database. Three machine learning classification algorithms are introduced: K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree
